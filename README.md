# PDA Radio

FOR GAME VERSION 2.0+ **LIVING LARGE**   
This mod allows radio messages to play automatically without having to click the radio. You DO NOT have to actually use your PDA to play the messages. The concept of the mod is that your PDA is playing the messages.    
There is a short delay before the message plays, to avoid playing over the top of the message that plays when the radio is repaired.
